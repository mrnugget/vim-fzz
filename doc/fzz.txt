INTRODUCTION                                    *fzz*

Use fzz to interactively search through files in Vim.

COMMANDS                                        *fzz-commands*

                                                *fzz-:Fzz*
:Fzz [arguments] {directory}
                        Opens fzz with the arguments an initial input to
                        the_silver_searcher.

                        If {directory} is given it is used as the last
                        argument for the_silver_searcher, effectively searching
                        only in {directory}.

                        The results of the search will be loaded into the
                        quickfix list.
